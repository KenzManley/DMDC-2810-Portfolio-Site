            What is a yurt?

            <p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. 
                Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor,
                 and a roof dome that can be opened.

            How are the yurts furnished?
        </h3>
            <p>
                Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.

            What should I bring?
         </h3>
            <p>
                Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. 
                It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
